### Course description

> An introduction to the principles and applications of computer science with an emphasis on understanding intercultural perspectives that arise during the design, implementation, and maintenance of mobile-ready web sites. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students learn the computational methods needed to create web sites that are useful to people from different cultures and nationalities. Students also investigate approaches to developing efficient, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing web sites that adhere to the international standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium. During a weekly laboratory session students use state-of-the-art web development technologies to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own [departmentally approved laptop](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/resources/laptops/) in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

* Prerequisite knowledge: `FS 102` or permission of the instructor
* Distribution requirements: `IP`,`SP`

### Required instructional materials

#### Textbook(s)

There are no textbooks for this course. Any texts or articles used will be available online or distributed by the instructor.

#### Platforms

This course relies on the [GitHub](https://www.github.com), and Discord platforms. Your work will be assigned and evaluated using these platforms and official course communication will take place through them. You are expected to sign up for accounts and remain active on these platforms throughout the semester.

##### A note on use of class platforms

These platforms are for our use only. To use them, you'll need to register and be logged into accounts associated with your Allegheny College email.

### Learning objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* 

### Governance and evaluation

This course's evaluation, participation and, eventually, grades, are governed by the [Course Contract](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

This, however, does not abrogate the role of this syllabus document. Provisions here work together with the contract. You should consider the information provided here the basic "givens" of the course.

#### Assignments

All course assignments are assigned and evaluated using the GitHub platform. I will only assess work correctly deposited there. Though the previous set of statements implies the following, I state it explicitly here to avoid misunderstanding: I _will only_ grade work that appears on the course GitHub.

#### Assessments

Any assessment in this course is open book, open note, and "open code." Of course, this means that questions I ask may not _directly_ test your memory and, instead, expect application of a concept.

##### Course project

This project offers students the opportunity to develop a realized version of an reasonably complex student-created project. Completion of this project will require use of the knowledge accumulated throughout the semester. Details for this project will be given out at the approximate mid-point of the semester. This task will require planning, careful evaluation, and implementation of a wide variety of concepts, and will allow students to choose and implement a project of their chosen discipline/application and approaches/methods. This project will be subject to approval by the instructor through a process including a formal proposal, interim updates, and technical reports.

### Course preparation

I expect students to arrive to class prepared. Here, "prepared" means having completed reading assignments, compiled questions, and being ready to engage thoughtfully with course material. In order to assist students' preparedness efforts, I will provide a [schedule](https://cmpsc302.chompe.rs) with assignments and will accompany all videos with a copy of any slides used in class proceedings or recorded media.

### Allegheny College Statement of Community

Allegheny College also expects students and faculty to act according to its Statement of Community:

> Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

Keep both of these standards in mind as you exercise your academic inquiry in this course. These serve as our fundamental "first principles" in pursuit of our shared academic goals.

### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students.  Such dialogue is encouraged.  However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone elseâ€™s work.  It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code.  Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the _Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Seeking assistance

#### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from the course instructor and teaching assistants. To meet with me, consult my available office hours (above) and make an appointment.

Historically, students who are successful in my courses visit and discuss course concepts with the instructor and Technical Leaders early and often. See [above for my office hours](#office-hours) or go to [this schedule for Technical Leaders' office hours](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/teaching/technicalleaders/).

#### Assistance outside of the course

If you find yourself in difficult circumstances which affect your ability to participate in or complete course work, let me know immediately. Full stop.

Do not wait until the end of the semester. 

Part of my role as a course instructor is to make sure that students receive the assistance they need. Do not hesitate to let me know if there is anything I can do with respect to your ability to handle your work. This is especially true of our current circumstances. Again, let me remind you -- __**it is part of my job**__ to help you access Allegheny College resources that will enable your safety and success.

In many situations, the following list of resources may help:

* [The Maytum Learning Commons](https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/)
* [Allegheny College Counseling Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/)
* [The Winslow Health Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/healthcenter/)
* [Student Life](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentlife/)

### Special needs and disability

Students with disabilities who need accommodations in this course are encouraged to contact Disability Services at `+1 814-334-2898`. Disability Services is part of the Learning Commons, located in Pelletier Library. Should you need accommodations, contact this office as soon as possible to ensure that approved accommodations are communicated and implemented as quickly as possible. This serves both you and me in providing the best environment for learning and support.
